# Miscellaneous: Yocto-I²C User Guide

In this project, we also consulted the Yocto-I²C User Guide as a concise, high-quality reference for I²C electrical levels, bus behavior, and practical command-line workflows. Although our hardware platform is two Raspberry Pi boards (not a Yoctopuce module), the guide’s explanations are broadly applicable to any I²C setup and helped us sanity-check our monitoring rules and wiring assumptions.
